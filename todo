*) make it so, on startup, new folder windows don't grab away focus.

*) fix move-to-back on message windows.

*) listeners:
	*) make sure that on disconnection that we remove all listeners.
	*) -- smtp threads, especially.
  *) (!!) make sure that smtp threads don't exit while there is still mail to
	be sent (!!)
  *) test UserProfile stuff to see if we're getting rid of all of them
	correctly.

*) on initial startup/config:  make sure it's clear that you can
	start up without a working smtp server.

*) encryption panel icons
*) new icons?
	*) new splashscreen
	*) ClearLooks icons
	  must be fixed:
		*) disconnected folder/subfolder (green)
		*) spam
		*) headers
		*) encryption panel.
		*) connection panel (traffic green etc.)
	  think about changing
		*) new message icon
		*) some others on the encryption panel
		*) refresh
		*) store connected/disconnected
		*) new locks

*) new attachment display w/icons?

*) fix fonts so they're no longer butt-ugly on windows

*) fix default font selector so it works on kunstoff and ocean

*) fix subjects with carriage returns

---

*) look at online bugs, etc.

*) change download link on site
*) make sure mailing list info is correct
*) update website in general

*) redo attachment display

*) exit:  closing window should pop up a notice saying pooka is still
	running; file->exit should exit.

*) fix mbox to make it useful (now you can't create new folders).  make it
	so you can make maildir-based folder.

*) make wheel scroll customizable

*) fix preview pane mode; make it look nice

*) undelete?

*) folder-check reopen attempts should only happen if the store is open
	or should be open.  they should not reopen the store.

*) webmail?????
	*) check out gmail and yahoo mail
	*) quick sample implementation?

*) check what happens if you hit enter on a subfolder while subscribing.
	-- see if we can make it so hitting enter opens the subfolder
	   rather than subscribing to it.

2.0 version
------
*) work out webstart code for tray icon.

*) change Item and ItemManager to using generics.

*) add taskbar support on gnome, windows, and mac?
  add start / bring up pooka
	-- change 2xclick action (?)
	should go:
	  connected:  1xclick=show status?  2xclick = bring to front?
	  	      rightclick=show menu
	  disconnected:  1xclick=show status?  2xclick=start up?
		      rightclick=show menu?
  add preferences dialog
  bug:  first call of right-click menu vanishes immediately. -- jdic bug?
  add in open message support?
	make the display nice?
  add support for showing disconnection messages?
  add disconnect/offline mode to right-click menu
	-- sort of done.
  figure out virtual desktop support???
  trayicon support:
	*) add changing message display timeout support
		easy in linux.  look up Shell_NotifyIcon for windows.
	*) fix resizing code -- should keep ratio
		...the reshape() method seems to be the problem.  call
		for legal values?
		...behaviour:  Icon should have a preferred size, past which
		it will try not to grow.  Icon should also have a setting
		for keeping the image ratio.  if the display is larger than
		the preferred ratio (1:1, but size wants to be 3:1) then
		icon should center.
	*) fix tooltip display code so it doesn't show off screen
		easy?  check.
  	*) ?? gnome focus stealing? -- see if you can make it so the update
		doesn't move focus from other random window.
	   -- look into focus stealing in general.
	*) should be able to tell if balloon is showing or not.
	*) should have a full MouseListener, not just an actionlistener.
	*) remove button border.
	*) check it out on windows?

*) update locking code with new mechanism.
-----------

*) see if we can make pooka start up on correct virtual desktop

*) add a spell checker -- jazzy????

*) virtual folder support <sigh>

*) add plugin for spam checker?

*) make sure non-ascii characters work in email text. -- and especially
	non-iso8859.

*) fix tableinfos so that you after a disconnect/reconnect you don't
	have to re-fetch the headers, only the flags.

*) add an option to build.xml for compiling with deprecation enabled.

*) fix non-plaintext-password support with imap (logindisabled)

*) add support for running without any local files.
   *) big tasks:  
      *) url access for all file resources
      *) relative paths for files/urls
	-- support for http: access?
	    -- fix variable bundle to make sure that we close the stream
	    -- better error messages
	    -- come up with configuration/usage plan.
	    -- make it so we can start as '--http URL' 
	-- figure out problem spots:
		*) pop3 support?
			-- ruling out pop3 boxes.
		*) outgoing mailboxes?
			-- works fine.  would be better if we allowed sent
			   folder and outbox to be reassigned on translation.
		*) address books?
			-- gives error on startup. -- still does.  sigh.
		*) encryption key files
			-- gives error.
  *) add support for running off of removable media (run from directory; cache/
	config files relative to config file)
	*) startup
	   - needs to ask where to get configuration file.  either can be 
	     http: or local file
	   - configuration file needs to support relative directories to
	     configuration file--so if conf file is in z:\pooka\pookarc,
	     then .\.pooka should map to z:\pooka\.pooka.
	*) usage
	   - export for http usage needs to be put in the correct place
		and tested.
  *) file list:  pgp/smime files, signature file, address book, ssl cert file,
	mbox file (n/a).
   -- also:  pooka home, mailcap file, pookarc file

*) check out situation with multiple connections.  see if we can speed
   up things that way.  possibilities:
	*) reuse our connections so we don't have to renegotiate ssl
	   connections each time.
	*) use separate threads for each folder so we can do the ssl
	   negotiation in parallel.

*) open store.  close store.  first, all the folders open anyway.  second,
	the folders opening are opening with a null action.  third, after
	the closing, the previously-loaded messages all go to 'loading'.

-----

*) consider:  move stuff from the bottom status area to the toolbar area.  or
   at least figure out something to use all that space for.

*) test w/gnu javamail -- ???
*) test w/javamail 1.3.2.

*) add a real debug system.

*) add support for saved searches.

*) add ability for ui components to be enabled/disabled programmatically.
	- both for adding to menus/tables and enabling/disabling options.
*) add a dependent button/menu item.  so that that way instead of having
	a separate Caching popup menu, you can just say "if caching,
	add this menu item; if not, don't."

------

*) separate out ui interfaces from swing implementations.

*) check too many open files error on opening large cached folder?

*) fix NPE if try to send a new message without configuring client.

*) add mark as unread 

*) new message count in icon

*) fix threading for drag and drop -- just try doing a big copy into a folder 
	with a paste operation.

*) start up disconnected.  connect.  have filters.  get error:
javax.mail.MessagingException: Error:  could not copy messages to folder:  net.suberic.pooka.cache.CachingFolderInfo@1e081c5

*) ?? change reply-all binding?

*) outgoing mailserver improvements:
	*) network connections - come up with a way to autotest that doesn't
		take lots of time.
	*) sending mail should try to autodetect mailserver to use
		*) each server has a connection list, or 'any'
		*) each user has a connection list, or 'any'
		*) each server for the user checks the connections in order.
		*) try to use the first available server
	*) on failure to send
		*) show error first.  save to outbox default?  work offine?
		*) offer to save to outbox if available
		*) -- don't offer to save to outbox if not available.
	*) offline setting???

*) check:  if a folder realizes that it has become disconnected, it should
	test to see if the store in general has disconnected.
	-- see what happens when the network goes down and then we try to
	check folder/store connection again.

*) some case(s) in which we're not generating the attachment bundle 
	correctly?  one instance is how we're handling multipart/alternative
	entries that don't actually have multiple parts.
	see pooka_problems blob

*) add color support for replies (i.e. > in one color, >> in another, etc.)

*) MessageRemovedException from UIDMimeMessage.getMessage() should result in 
	message getting removed from display. (? does this ever happen?)

-----

*) encryption improvements.
   *) if no keystore named, don't try loading?  test.
	-- we still get errors there.  fix.
   *) make keystores get updated if you change them while running.  in other
	words, don't require a restart for encryption the first time.
	  -- done.  make update only happen once per change, though.
   *) add documentation
	*) need to document versions, including webstart cryptix info
	*) need to document unlimited strength jce info
   *) test autodecrypt/auto sig check.  requires keys synched to email address.
	test
   *) test auto sign/auto encrypt.
	test
   *) key management
	  - make sure you can use alternate keys even if one is set for
		the default user.
   *) fix keyboard focus on passphrase entry (make textfield have focus).
   *) encryption action should offer key list if no default key for address.
	-- figure out timing of that.
   *) make sure UI shows up for auto-encrypted messages.
   *) when selecting a key, have options for encryption (always use this key,
	etc.)
   *) fix threading on encryption actions.
     *) !!! we're parsing each message on load now. !!!


*) fix error in encoded stream problem.
	-- just better error (?)  or maybe print out as far as it goes.
	-- see pooka_problems from plc

*) html with text attachment should show text attachment at the end. (??)

*) modify built-in java display code to show download dialog for showing
	attachments.

*) change the keybinding for the address book.  otherwise you get address book
	entries while you're navigating the to field.

*) make VariableBundle support #include, or something like it.
	*) split out .pookarc into config and runtimes files/sections

*) add "view pookarc"

*) add console?

*) theme bug in folder table display between preview and desktop.

------

*) add mrpostman support(?)

*) printing
	*) better layout of printer frame.  center things?

*) make it so folder windows save their settings (column width, sort order)

*) more doc

*) add documentation and online help.
  -- general info, plus more detailed configuration information.
	topics:
	  running pooka
	  copyright/gpl
	  keybindings
	  configuring stores (imap,pop3,mbox)
	  reading mail
	  new mail
	  user profiles
	  outgoing mail config
	  network connections
	  disconnected operation
	  address book
	  searches
	  subscribing/unsubscribing folders
	  ui types
	  trash folder
	  sent folder
	  outgoing mail folder

*) add help for config stuff.


-------

*) make there a build option for help only, so i can switch it in 
	WebStart.

*) fix up the error messages, and make sure that they look ok.

*) document keybindings
	-- keybindings for address book
	-- keybindings for address entry panel
	-- keybindings for saving attachments.
	-- keybindings for opening folders.
	-- keybindings for detachwindow

*) make it so there's a way to close the store that actually resets
	the connection totally, so that if your network is screwed up 
	pooka can recover without restarting.

-----

*) additional crypto stuff
	- different KeyStores for different users?

*) regexp? (add search/replace to editor)
  -- started.  todo:
	*) add feature to NewMessage
	*) add replace feature
		-- check the caret location, too.
	
*) fix connection failed message for ssl stores -- only fixable by sun?
	-- test under 1.3.2.

*) check for memory leaks
 -- especially w/preview pane mode?

*) preview pane: 
	--make it so the status bar is at the bottom, underneath
	the readmessagedisplaypanel--or possibly on the status pane.
	-- maybe change the toolbars so there's only 1?
	-- ?? make it so you can compose messages in the main window ??
  -- switching from preview to desktop gives outbox a "normal" toolbar.
  -- switching from desktop to preview, hitting return both opens window
	and shows the message in the preview pane.

*) ui:  stack trace button should really be with ok button, not by itself.

*) NPE -- is that from switching from preview to desktop?
	-- check window menu from switching preview to desktop.

*) disconnected from store (like if the server goes down) doesn't result in 
icons changing?  test.

*) disconnected:  
	*)  make an option for caching everything.
	*)  check sent folder with disconnected / especially not using
		the NetworkConnection object. -- note:  ok with the
		NetworkConnection.
	      -- making that work better.  now we add the message, but
	         it shows up as not cached.  also, change the algorithm
	         for numbering.
	*)  disconnected:  think that you're still connected.  lose connection.
	    get new messages.  doesn't work properly.
	*)  reading a message in disconnected mode doesn't actually mark
	     it read. -- ?? test.  seems to work.
	*)  add:  autocache up to a certain size.

*) editors:  add listeners:  intFilter, enabledIfOtherFilter.  requiredFilter.

*) umm, implement tile and cascade.  :)

*) make it so you can add to the address book from the selection
		panel.

*) threading of attachment actions.

*) add ldap support

----------------------


*) add support for jdk1.4
	-- new focus architecture
	-- new keybinding architecture
	-- InputVerifier

*) add a keybinding to bring up the address book selector.

*) spam filtering

*) forward to all.
 
*) fix the network connection test so that it doesn't hang if the
	network is up, but the test host is unreachable.

*) make sure that if you close a store, it doesn't reopen it.
	-- ?? should work.  look for testcase.

*) ?? add a notification to a message which has been deleted while fastDelete
	is enabled, but hasn't yet actually been removed.

*) come up with a wrapper for spawning external editors on windows.

*) make it so folders that can contain folders but have no subfolders have
	the correct icon.

*) get some decent pooka icons.
	
*) search for sent folders ends up doing loading on the display thread.

*) make search window look different than normal window.

*) add 'filter by message'

*) remove 'where' clause from filter.

*) add support for hierarchical new message notification--so getting an email
	in foo/bar would show up on foo as well as bar.

*) add icons for connecting to folder/store

*) make it so we only get one connection failed message for a store.

*) sent folders, outboxes, etc. should be configured without requiring a
	restart.  also, should be able to change store protcol/connection
	info without restarting.

*) fix:java.lang.NullPointerException
	at net.suberic.pooka.FolderInfo.getTrashFolder(Unknown Source)
	at net.suberic.pooka.MultiMessageInfo.deleteMessage(Unknown Source)
	(from search folder)

*) fix:java.lang.NullPointerException
	at net.suberic.pooka.gui.MessageProxy.refreshMessage(MessageProxy.java:353)
	at net.suberic.pooka.thread.LoadMessageThread.loadWaitingMessages(LoadMessageThread.java:185)
	at net.suberic.pooka.thread.LoadMessageThread.run(LoadMessageThread.java:53)

*) make it so you can stop html displays from showing non-local images.
 	-- support RFC-2557??
*) bug:  html text is always black, no matter the theme or the 
specifications in the html itself.

	-- disconnected imap --

*) check to see what happens when we lose our connection before all of
	the messages are loaded (esp. before the tableinfos are loaded)

*) we're getting a weird flash of 'loading', probably when we're caching
	the message.

*) each loading of the FolderTableInfo rechecks the unread message
	count, which sucks for performance.  improvements with new
	caching system???

*) each loading we also recache the flags no matter what.  this is probably
not very efficient.

*) reply to an email from you should go to the recipient.

---

*)  check all of my actions and make sure that they are threading 
properly--both that the email work is being done on the proper thread,
and that all the gui updates are happening on the EventDispatcher thread.

*) bug:  make sure all of the showError, etc. methods are on the AWTEventThread
rather than the calling thread.

*)  all MessagingExceptions should be handled correctly, not ignored.  there
should only be a few of these left.

*) mail import?

*) follow-ups?

*) write html mail?

*) 'advanced searching'

*) search folders

*) 'do not download this mail' rule

*) labels?

*) message threading

*) make an option where message windows size to the viewport of the
desktop pane.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

*)  when you change users for a new message, then, even if the theme 
doesn't change, you still resize the window.

*) add support for external editors, such as emacs.

*) address book/ldap support.
	now:
	1)  add ldap support

	later:
	1)  make sure the matches go with the entry--i.e. if you match the
	    actual address, have the actual address appear first.
	2)  make it test for valid email addresses
	3)  make it add an extension to incomplete and unmatched addresses
	    (i.e. change 'allen' to 'allen@somehostname.org')
	4)  change the UI so that matched address aliases display differently
		(bold, in a different color, or some such).  that way a
		user can tell if the entered address is a proper alias or not.


*) fix the launcher (specifically the html launcher, but maybe all of them)
to use "'s correctly.  works for now with opera, which should be good 
enough...

error:  filterfoldercellrenderer has problems with search forms.

*) check:  see how outgoing and incoming mail handle tab characters.
	-- a little bit of a bug, but not too much.  should probably
	check the actual message source to see how tabs are sent.

*)  make the windows detachable. 
	-- done, at least for read messages and new message.
	-- to fix:  
	-- *)  make it not get included for preview pane ui windows.
	-- *)  make it available for folder windows?
	-- *)  the windows are being resized, meaning that if you make the
	       window larger and then detach it, or if you move the split
		pane divider, then it reverts to its original state when you
		detach/attach the window.

*) add threading of messages (?) 

*) set priority (?)

*) expand an unopened store in the folder tree that has folders and
	subfolders.  connect to the store.  the subfolders close back up.
	-- i think that happens when you have 'sync with subscribed folders'		  set.

*) loadMessageTracker?  it doesn't seem to show up anymore.

*)  make it so file->exit gives you the option for expunging deleted messages
    from your mailboxes.

*) bug:  if you go into the multi configuration editors and it's empty, you
should more or less be forced to create a new entity.  otherwise you'll start
typing in information and then be surprised when add clears it out.

*) bug:  trying to go to a folder editor when there aren't any folders
or stores configured is a big problem.

*) a nested message which is of type text/html doesn't get shown on the
	display.

*) enable voice control

*) make a way to edit the mailcap bindings other than just the 'make default'
option.

*) multi-deleted throw a NPE

*) currently, we only really support a signature file, though the ability
is there to do all kinds of signature generators.  implement support for
alternate signature methods.

*)  implement a way to make a custom FolderCellRenderer for a property.

*)  implement (likely similar) way to put constraints/checks on the values
entered through a propertyEditor.

*) make the scrolling work properly for all border cases, such as a single new
window at -5, -5.

*) add interfaces for all the rest of the features.  :)

*) add 'edit message as new' for normal messages.

*) add support for flowed text

*) add ability to edit received messages, so you can do things like remove
attachments that you don't want to keep (?) -- and change the subject.

*) name all of your threads.

*) customize settings on folder window--headers, window size.

*) add customization editor for toolbars and menus. 

*) make required fields for the gui properties.

*) check it to see if we can still get the same kind of 
	folders-always-available performance while not keeping a separate
	imapd connection open for each folder.

the Spice is life
