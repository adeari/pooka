beta 1
---------------

*) add disconnected imap support.  thoughts:  1)  cache headers so that we
can make an InternetHeaders object.  2)  cache full messages so we can get
all the information we need off the Message.  3)  effectively have a 'real'
message which is what you make changes on.  4)  searches won't work in 
disconnected mode.

*) add pop3/local mail spool support.
	in progress.  todo:
	 *)  some messages aren't parsed properly by the mbox provider
	 *)  the mbox provider isn't safe for mailboxes that are edited by
	     other processes.
	 *)  need to add support for keeping the messages in the mailbox
	     while you have them on disk.
	 *)  bug:  messages currently aren't being deleted off the pop
	     server. -- fixed?
	 *)  update the ui so that you can properly configure pop/mbox/imap
	     store separately.

*) support for ssl?

*) bug:  new message notification doesn't work for folders with both messages
and subfolders.

*) bug:  send mail seems to be on the awt event thread.

*) bug:  the MenuBar.Mail.Move resource isn't loaded on first startup.

*) check:  see how outgoing and incoming mail handle tab characters.
	-- a little bit of a bug, but not too much.  should probably
	check the actual message source to see how tabs are sent.

*) bug:  messages that are new for the session (i.e. showed up between the
last time you ran the client and this time) aren't marked as recent--only
ones that come in while you're already connected are labelled like that.

*) add address book and alias support -- jph

--

*) add copying messages.

ui engine
---------
*)  make the windows detachable. 
	-- done, at least for read messages and new message.
	-- to fix:  1)  location isn't quite right for top-level frame to
	   intenral frame change. -- only on linux?
	-- 2)  make it not get included for preview pane ui windows.
	-- 3)  make it available for folder windows?
	-- 4)  the windows are being resized, meaning that if you make the
	       window larger and then detach it, or if you move the split
		pane divider, then it reverts to its original state when you
		detach/attach the window.

*) fix all of the thread issues that i've introduced.  :)

general ui
----------
*) revamp the UserProfile, Store, and Folder editing process.  make a full
screen for each with all the possible information (update time, colors,
connection information, trash/sent folders, etc.) available, and make it
so you can edit them by right-clicking on the folder.  in other words, do
a big ui overhaul.

*) add undo/redo support

protocol support
----------------
*) fix the jfilechooser so it doesn't disconnect all of our folders when you
use it--or at least so it doesn't matter if it does.  -- only on unix.  
	doesn't happen on linux with latest glibc?

searching
---------
*) add something to search through all messages in the folder.

*) add support for mail filters.
	to be supported:
	match:  header, subject, date, flags
	match type:  (not) contains, is, begins with, ends with, is before,
	 	     is after
	actions:  move to folder, change priority, delete, mark read

*) add a search and replace for the message editors.

other
-----
*) loadMessageTracker?

after beta 1
----------------

*) fix the startup bugs:  
	1)  windows take too long to show up
	2)  sometimes the mailboxes are marked as broken when they shouldn't
		be. * note:  i put in a possible workaround for this.

*) enable voice control

*) make a way to edit the mailcap bindings other than just the 'make default'
option.

*) currently, we only really support a signature file, though the ability
is there to do all kinds of signature generators.  implement support for
alternate signature methods.

*)  implement a way to make a custom FolderCellRenderer for a property.

*)  implement (likely similar) way to put constraints/checks on the values
entered through a propertyEditor.

*)  check on file->exit to make sure that there are no unsent messages,
and give an option on what you want to do with each one if there are any.

*)  make it so file->exit gives you the option for expunging deleted messages
    from your mailboxes.

*)  check all of my actions and make sure that they are threading 
properly--both that the email work is being done on the proper thread,
and that all the gui updates are happening on the EventDispatcher thread.

*)  all MessagingExceptions should be handled correctly, not ignored.

*) make the scrolling work properly for all border cases, such as a single new
window at -5, -5.

*) make printing nicer--it's pretty basic now.

*) select all/all messages

*) add interfaces for all the rest of the features.  :)

*) add more font support

*) add 'edit message as new'

*) add ldap support

*) add pgp/gpg support.

*) add ability to edit received messages, so you can do things like remove
attachments that you don't want to keep (?)

*) fix sorting of the from field--make it case-insensitive.

*) name all of your threads.

*) add color support

*) customize settings on folder window--headers, window size.

*) add ability of setting return values by hand (not by UserProfile) on 
	new messages.

*) make required fields for the gui properties.

make an update Thread -- sort of done.  need to institute update time.

attachments available from message list.

the Spice is life

write profile changes to disk immediately on setting (?)

add support for using an external editor, like emacs.
