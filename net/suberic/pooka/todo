*)  Make it so that there is some sort of alert (even just bolding the folder
nodes in the tree on the left) when a folder has new messages.  

*)  Make sure that the stores and folders stay open--right now, if you leave
them alone for long enough, they close and aren't reopened. -- done?

*)  StatusBar on the FolderWindow should get updated when messages come in
or are deleted.

*)  Fix the display of the MultiPropertyEditor.

*)  Add the ability to subscribe to/add new folders in the GUI.

*)  add ability to attach files to the sent messages.

*)  add context-sensitive menus (right-click menus)

*)  add send buttons and other appropriate commands to MessageWindow.

*)  make the GUI Authenticator (which should come up when you don't enter
your password in the Store Configuration) work--right now it doesn't.

*)  enable cut & paste

*)  make the windows detachable.

*)  implement a way to make a custom FolderCellRenderer for a property.

*)  implement (likely similar) way to put constraints/checks on the values
entered through a propertyEditor.

*)  currently can't delete multiple messages at once.

*)  make window selection work after windows are closed--currently, if you
close your selected window, no window is selected.  it should be that the
next window in the stack (?) gets selected automatically.
open messages from the FolderWindow
	can do.  todo on this:
	customize settings--headers, window size.
	check the window size if there are lots of 'to' or 'cc' entries.

create and send message
	can do.  todo on this:
	fix the signature
	add ability of setting return values by hand (not by UserProfile)
	make a sent folder
	make it so that if there are any errors sending the message, that it's
		saved and editable.  not quite sure what to do there with a 
		send thread, but....

user profiles/information
	can do.  todo:
	make it actually get the correct default profile.
	make entry list defaults not editable.
	make sure that the sendMailURL is properly updated as soon as it's
		entered.  i think right now you have to restart, or reopen
		folders, or something like that.

Editing Profiles/Stores
	can do.  todo:
		make things update dynamically--FolderPane and input
			boxes.	
		make required fields.

auth fails isn't caught

closing the window doesn't exit program.

make an update Thread -- sort of done.  need to institute update time.

attachments available from message list.

implement Window Menu as Dynamic Menu.

the Spice is life

add Font stuff.

hourglass for blocking actions--fix it.

BUGS
---------
Send is enabled for read (non-editable) messages.

actions on messageProxy aren't available for MessageWindow--and ones on 
MessageWindow aren't available for the selected message in the table.

updates of pkamailrc aren't handled correctly--some lines aren't deleted.

actions on FolderPanel are always available in the menu.

none of the window sizings are right.
