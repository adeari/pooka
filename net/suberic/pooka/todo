*)  Fix the display of the MultiPropertyEditor.--especially the 'don't show
the password on the screen' part.

*)  Add the ability to subscribe to/add new folders in the GUI.

*)  add ability to attach files to the sent messages.

*)  add context-sensitive menus (right-click menus)

*)  add send buttons and other appropriate commands to MessageWindow.

*)  make the GUI Authenticator (which should come up when you don't enter
your password in the Store Configuration) work--right now it doesn't.  note:
it actually works ok (just ok) when you start it up from scratch--but when
you make a new Store without a password, it shows up lots and lots of times
and basically just fails all over the place.

*)  enable cut & paste

*)  make the windows detachable.

*)  implement a way to make a custom FolderCellRenderer for a property.

*)  implement (likely similar) way to put constraints/checks on the values
entered through a propertyEditor.

*)  currently can't delete multiple messages at once.

*)  make window selection work after windows are closed--currently, if you
close your selected window, no window is selected.  it should be that the
next window in the stack (?) gets selected automatically.

*)  all MessagingExceptions should be handled correctly, not (as in 
MessageWindow) ignored.

*)  the piece of code that keeps the Stores open only starts up if you open
a FolderWindow.  so if you just start up the program and don't open any windows
for a while, your connection to your Store can go down.

open messages from the FolderWindow
	can do.  todo on this:
	customize settings--headers, window size.
	check the window size if there are lots of 'to' or 'cc' entries.

create and send message
	can do.  todo on this:
	fix the signature
	add ability of setting return values by hand (not by UserProfile)
	make a sent folder
	make it so that if there are any errors sending the message, that it's
		saved and editable.  not quite sure what to do there with a 
		send thread, but....

user profiles/information
	can do.  todo:
	make it actually get the correct default profile.
	make entry list defaults not editable.
	make sure that the sendMailURL is properly updated as soon as it's
		entered.  i think right now you have to restart, or reopen
		folders, or something like that.

Editing Profiles/Stores
	can do.  todo:
		make things update dynamically--FolderPane and input
			boxes.	
		make required fields.

auth fails isn't caught

closing the window doesn't exit program.

make an update Thread -- sort of done.  need to institute update time.

attachments available from message list.

implement Window Menu as Dynamic Menu.

the Spice is life

add Font stuff.

hourglass for blocking actions--fix it.

implement the signatures properly.  

write profile changes to disk immediately on setting (?)

BUGS
---------
Send is enabled for read (non-editable) messages.

actions on messageProxy aren't available for MessageWindow--and ones on 
MessageWindow aren't available for the selected message in the table.

updates of pkamailrc aren't handled correctly--some lines aren't deleted.

actions on FolderPanel are always available in the menu.

none of the window sizings are right.

adding a new UserProfile isn't noticed by the new message window--you still get
only the old choices until you restart.
