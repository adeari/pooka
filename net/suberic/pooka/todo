*) make the NewAccountPooka make a more fully-featured account; i.e. allow
	for laptop configurations, sent folder configuration, etc.
	include the .pooka directory configuration.
	started:  todo:
	*) make it so it actually opens your inbox.
	*) configure sent folder
	*) configure outbox.
	*) premake ssl file.
	*) make us test the connection to the configured servers first.
	*) pop:  keep message on folder, etc.
	*) gen:  actually make .pooka dir config do something.

*) get rid of the Edit button for the Variable setting.  make it a separate
	pane instead or something.
	-- started.  todo:
	*) add listeners:  intFilter, enabledIfOtherFilter.  requiredFilter.

*) queuing of outgoing mails
	todo on this:
	*)  fix the local mail store so that it doesn't necessarily put
		in an INBOX for everything.  this is so we can set up a
		local mail store for IMAP users without having to fake
		out the INBOX for it.
	*)  add some sort of an administrative api to the NetworkConnection
		so that the application and the admin tools (the bottom right
		config) don't have the same restrictions (or lack thereof).
		 -- somewhat started with the new test address api.
	*)  change the new user setup so that it configures an outbox
		automatically.
	*)  change the new user setup so that it configures a sent folder
		automatically.
	*) make it so there is some way for the NetworkConnection to detect
		whether or not it's up.
			-- started.  make sure it's enough.

*) make a way to reopen folders that have been disconnected other than
	closing and reopening the store.
	-- make a disconnected icon.

*) splashscreen?

*) run a debug log on the communications with the imap server; make sure
that we get all of the important information in the body tag.  -- ?? check
the filters, especially.

*) add icons for connecting to folder/store, for disconnected, and for
	the root node.

--------

*) document keybindings
	-- keybindings for address book
	-- keybindings for saving attachments.
	-- keybindings for opening folders.
	-- keybindings for detachwindow

*) threading of attachment actions.

*) preview pane: 
	--make it so the status bar is at the bottom, underneath
	the readmessagedisplaypanel--or possibly on the status pane.
	-- maybe change the toolbars so there's only 1?
	-- ?? make it so you can compose messages in the main window ??

*) NPE -- is that from switching from preview to desktop?
	-- check window menu from switching preview to desktop.

	-- search --

*) make search give a popup window saying it's running, or at least something
	that makes it obvious that _something's_ going on.

*) make search window look different than normal window.

*) search doesn't work properly for sent folders.

*) disconnected from store (like if the server goes down) doesn't result in 
icons changing?  test.

preview:
	check what happens when we switch from desktop to preview and
		autopreview is off

*) disconnected:  
	*)  make an option for caching everything.
	*)  check sent folder with disconnected / especially not using
		the NetworkConnection object. -- note:  ok with the
		NetworkConnection.
	      -- making that work better.  now we add the message, but
	         it shows up as not cached.  also, change the algorithm
	         for numbering.
	*)  disconnected:  think that you're still connected.  lose connection.
	    get new messages.  doesn't work properly.
	*)  reading a message in disconnected mode doesn't actually mark
	     it read. -- ?? test.  seems to work.

*) address book:  make it so you can bring up your address book while 
	addressing messages, and pull choices from there into your
	address field.

*) attachments available from message list (by default)

*)  add documentation and online help.

*)  fix up the error messages, and make sure that they look ok.

*)  ?? if network connection goes down, pooka hangs on exit.

+++++++

*) add support for jdk1.4
	-- tabbing between the address components for New Messages
	-- the MailFileSystemView doesn't seem to work at all (!)
	-- up and down arrows while composing new messages.
	-- ssl doesn't work.

*) fix the network connection test so that it doesn't hang if the
	network is up, but the test host is unreachable.

*) support java jnlp (?)

*) come up with a wrapper for spawning external editors on windows.

*) get some decent pooka icons.
	
*) add support for saved searches.

*) add 'filter by message'

*) fix:java.lang.NullPointerException
	at net.suberic.pooka.MessageInfo.remove(Unknown Source)
	at net.suberic.pooka.MessageInfo.deleteMessage(Unknown Source)
java.lang.NullPointerException
	at net.suberic.pooka.MessageInfo.remove(MessageInfo.java:389)
	at net.suberic.pooka.MessageInfo.deleteMessage(MessageInfo.java:358)
	at net.suberic.pooka.gui.MessageProxy.deleteMessage(MessageProxy.java:673)
	at net.suberic.pooka.gui.MessageProxy.deleteMessage(MessageProxy.java:755)
	at net.suberic.pooka.gui.MessageProxy$DeleteAction.actionPerformed(MessageProxy.java:1173)
	at net.suberic.util.thread.ActionThread.run(ActionThread.java:72)


*) fix:java.lang.NullPointerException
	at net.suberic.pooka.FolderInfo.getTrashFolder(Unknown Source)
	at net.suberic.pooka.MultiMessageInfo.deleteMessage(Unknown Source)
	(from search folder)

*) fix:java.lang.NullPointerException
	at net.suberic.pooka.gui.MessageProxy.refreshMessage(MessageProxy.java:353)
	at net.suberic.pooka.thread.LoadMessageThread.loadWaitingMessages(LoadMessageThread.java:185)
	at net.suberic.pooka.thread.LoadMessageThread.run(LoadMessageThread.java:53)

*) make it so you can stop html displays from showing non-local images.
 	-- support RFC-2557??

*) add support for composing new email messages from an external source,
say, like reacting to a mailto: link.

*) add a search and replace for the message editors.

*) check the open/close/open pattern on disconnected folders.

	-- disconnected imap --

*) check to see what happens when we lose our connection before all of
	the messages are loaded (esp. before the tableinfos are loaded)

*) we're getting a weird flash of 'loading', probably when we're caching
	the message.

*) each loading of the FolderTableInfo rechecks the unread message
	count, which sucks for performance.  improvements with new
	caching system???

*) each loading we also recache the flags no matter what.  this is probably
not very efficient.

---

*)  check all of my actions and make sure that they are threading 
properly--both that the email work is being done on the proper thread,
and that all the gui updates are happening on the EventDispatcher thread.

*) bug:  make sure all of the showError, etc. methods are on the AWTEventThread
rather than the calling thread.

*)  all MessagingExceptions should be handled correctly, not ignored.  there
should only be a few of these left.

*) add ability of setting return values by hand (not by UserProfile) on 
	new messages.


*) make an option where message windows size to the viewport of the
desktop pane.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

*)  when you change users for a new message, then, even if the theme 
doesn't change, you still resize the window.

*) add pgp/gpg support.

*) read messages don't get font color set properly.  works in jdk1.4.

*) add support for external editors, such as emacs.

*) address book/ldap support.
	now:
	1)  add ldap support

	later:
	1)  make sure the matches go with the entry--i.e. if you match the
	    actual address, have the actual address appear first.
	2)  make it test for valid email addresses
	3)  make it add an extension to incomplete and unmatched addresses
	    (i.e. change 'allen' to 'allen@somehostname.org')


*) fix the launcher (specifically the html launcher, but maybe all of them)
to use "'s correctly.  works for now with opera, which should be good 
enough...

error:  filterfoldercellrenderer has problems with search forms.

*) check:  see how outgoing and incoming mail handle tab characters.
	-- a little bit of a bug, but not too much.  should probably
	check the actual message source to see how tabs are sent.

*)  make the windows detachable. 
	-- done, at least for read messages and new message.
	-- to fix:  
	-- *)  make it not get included for preview pane ui windows.
	-- *)  make it available for folder windows?
	-- *)  the windows are being resized, meaning that if you make the
	       window larger and then detach it, or if you move the split
		pane divider, then it reverts to its original state when you
		detach/attach the window.

*) add a spell checker

*) add threading of messages (?) 

*) set priority (?)

*) expand an unopened store in the folder tree that has folders and
	subfolders.  connect to the store.  the subfolders close back up.

*) loadMessageTracker?  it doesn't seem to show up anymore.

*)  make it so file->exit gives you the option for expunging deleted messages
    from your mailboxes.

*) bug:  if you go into the multi configuration editors and it's empty, you
should more or less be forced to create a new entity.  otherwise you'll start
typing in information and then be surprised when add clears it out.

*) bug:  trying to go to a folder editor when there aren't any folders
or stores configured is a big problem.

*) some messages aren't parsed properly by the mbox provider.
*) the mbox provider isn't safe for mailboxes that are edited by
	     other processes.

*) fix the jfilechooser so it doesn't disconnect all of our folders when you
use it--or at least so it doesn't matter if it does.  -- only on unix.  
	doesn't happen on linux with latest glibc?

*) a nested message which is of type text/html doesn't get shown on the
	display.

*) enable voice control

*) make a way to edit the mailcap bindings other than just the 'make default'
option.

*) multi-deleted throw a NPE

*) currently, we only really support a signature file, though the ability
is there to do all kinds of signature generators.  implement support for
alternate signature methods.

*)  implement a way to make a custom FolderCellRenderer for a property.

*)  implement (likely similar) way to put constraints/checks on the values
entered through a propertyEditor.

*) make the scrolling work properly for all border cases, such as a single new
window at -5, -5.

*) make printing nicer--it's pretty basic now.

*) add interfaces for all the rest of the features.  :)

*) add ldap support

*) add 'edit message as new' for normal messages.

*) add ability to edit received messages, so you can do things like remove
attachments that you don't want to keep (?)

*) name all of your threads.

*) customize settings on folder window--headers, window size.

*) make required fields for the gui properties.

*) check it to see if we can still get the same kind of 
	folders-always-available performance while not keeping a separate
	imapd connection open for each folder.

make an update Thread -- sort of done.  need to institute update time.
