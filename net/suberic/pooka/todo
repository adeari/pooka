alpha 2
----------

*)  add a way to edit the mailcap file.  this should be doable both from
a menu option and from the 'open with' dialog.

*) fix the signature -- started, anyway.  need to add a keybinding for 
	inserting the sig, support for signature as a file, support for
	signature as a generator....  lots of stuff, i suppose.

*) bug:  fix what happens if you try sending out a bad email.  also, while
	we're at it, make sure that the from: and smtp: information get 
	updated live.

*)  get JFileChooser to work with the mail stores.  sort of done; still
	need to deal with disconnection issues and return value issues.
	 -- disconnection:  check to see if the Store is actually staying
	    open or not.

-- final checks before alpha 2 release.

*) bug:  check the internal frame / window focus issue--make sure that 
	the selected frame always has keyboard focus, and that the keyboard
	focus defaults to a reasonable place.

*) add keyboard control for everything, including switching between internal
frames and the folderPanel.  oh, and making it so you can get at the menus.
	-- most of that's done.  need to check on alt+f under jdk 1.2.2, and
	...  probably just do another run through for all the options before
	we finish.

after alpha 2
----------------

*) enable voice control

*)  make the windows detachable.

*) add an optional preview pane.

*) add a search and replace for the message editors.

*) add pop3/local mail spool support.

*) add disconnected imap support.

*) add something to search through all messages in the folder.

*) revamp the UserProfile, Store, and Folder editing process.  make a full
screen for each with all the possible information (update time, colors,
connection information, trash/sent folders, etc.) available, and make it
so you can edit them by right-clicking on the folder.  in other words, do
a big ui overhaul.

*)  fix the out of memory problems--only load a certain amount of large
messages.  for that matter, maybe also do an optimizeit audit.

*)  implement a way to make a custom FolderCellRenderer for a property.

*)  implement (likely similar) way to put constraints/checks on the values
entered through a propertyEditor.

*)  check on file->exit to make sure that there are no unsent messages,
and give an option on what you want to do with each one if there are any.

*)  check all of my actions and make sure that they are threading 
properly--both that the email work is being done on the proper thread,
and that all the gui updates are happening on the EventDispatcher thread.

*)  all MessagingExceptions should be handled correctly, not ignored.

*) delete for multiple messages takes way too long.

*) takes too long to open a window where there are a lot of new messages.

*) make the scrolling work properly for all border cases, such as a single new
window at -5, -5.

*) fix the display of the messages in the FolderWindow--right now, you get
too much date info, not enough Subject.

*) make printing nicer--it's pretty basic now.

*) add the ability to save messages to files.

*) add ability to reply/forward with attachments, or as inline, and so forth

*) add copying messages.

*) add undo/redo support

*) select all/all messages

*) add interfaces for all the rest of the features.  :)

*) add support for mail filters.

*) add more font support

*) add 'edit message as new'

*) add address book and alias support

*) add ldap support

*) add pgp/gpg support.

*) add ability to edit received messages, so you can do things like remove
attachments that you don't want to keep (?)

*) fix sorting of the from field--make it case-insensitive.

-------

open messages from the FolderWindow
	can do.  todo on this:
	customize settings--headers, window size.
	check the window size if there are lots of 'to' or 'cc' entries.

create and send message
	can do.  todo on this:
	fix the signature
	add ability of setting return values by hand (not by UserProfile)
	make a sent folder

user profiles/information
	can do.  todo:
	make sure that the sendMailURL is properly updated as soon as it's
		entered.  i think right now you have to restart, or reopen
		folders, or something like that.

Editing Profiles/Stores
	can do.  todo:
		make required fields.

closing the window doesn't exit program.

make an update Thread -- sort of done.  need to institute update time.

attachments available from message list.

the Spice is life

add Font stuff.

hourglass for blocking actions--fix it. -?? may be a 1.2 bug; things work
fine in 1.3.

implement the signatures properly.  

write profile changes to disk immediately on setting (?)

BUGS
---------
updates of pkamailrc aren't handled correctly--some lines aren't deleted.

actions on FolderPanel are always available in the menu.
