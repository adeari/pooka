	-- disconnect imap --

*) disconnected imap is way too slow.  

*) caching messages marks them as read.

*) no way to cache messages as they come in.

*) new messages seem to be loaded last.

*) in general, make reconnecting/resynching (with disconnected imap or
	with the uid system) use the LoadMessageThread.  also make the
	LoadMessageThread use the main FolderThread synchronization.

*) new message count on disconnected imap folders is a bit strange.  might 
want to get it from the cache instead of the folder itself when we haven't
downloaded the new messages yet.  kind of weird to see '6 new messages' and
have nothing new in your inbox because it hasn't been d/l'ed yet.

*) incorrect number of messages/unread messages when in disconnected mode.

*) check reading uncached messages; it should happen that if you try to
read an uncached message twice in a row, you should get the same error
message.

*) get rid of the 'comparing new messages...' status message after you're
	done!

*) check to see what happens when we lose our connection before all of
	the messages are loaded (esp. before the tableinfos are loaded)

*) add a POOKA_HOME option.

---

*) make it so the connection objects actually have a clue as to whether
or not they're actually connected, instead of relying on the user.

*) preview pane:  make it so the status bar is at the bottom, underneath
	the readmessagedisplaypanel--or possibly on the status pane.
	-- maybe change the toolbars so there's only 1?
	-- make the separator show up at the right place.
	-- ?? make it so you can compose messages in the main window ??
	-- make it so it doesn't automatically display the first new message.

*) make it so the default text/image viewer actually works.

---
*) queuing of outgoing mails
	todo on this:
	*)  fix the local mail store so that it doesn't necessarily put
		in an INBOX for everything.  this is so we can set up a
		local mail store for IMAP users without having to fake
		out the INBOX for it.
	*)  add some sort of an administrative api to the NetworkConnection
		so that the application and the admin tools (the bottom right
		config) don't have the same restrictions (or lack thereof).
	*)  change the new user setup so that it configures an outbox
		automatically.
	*) make it so there is some way for the NetworkConnection to detect
		whether or not it's up.

	-- search --

*) make search give a popup window saying it's running, or at least something
	that makes it obvious that _something's_ going on.

*) make search window look different than normal window.

------------

*) address book:  make it so you can bring up your address book while 
	addressing messages, and pull choices from there into your
	address field.

*) attachments available from message list (by default)

*) make the NewAccountPooka make a more fully-featured account; i.e. allow
	for laptop configurations, sent folder configuration, etc.

*) get rid of the Edit button for the Variable setting.  make it a separate
	pane instead or something.

*)  add documentation and online help.

+++++++

*) add support for jdk1.4
	-- tabbing between the address components for New Messages
	-- the MailFileSystemView doesn't seem to work at all (!)
	-- up and down arrows while composing new messages.
	-- ssl doesn't work.

*) support java jnlp (?)

*) come up with a wrapper for spawning external editors on windows.

*) get some decent pooka icons.
	
*) add support for composing new email messages from an external source,
say, like reacting to a mailto: link.

*) add a search and replace for the message editors.

*)  check all of my actions and make sure that they are threading 
properly--both that the email work is being done on the proper thread,
and that all the gui updates are happening on the EventDispatcher thread.

*) bug:  make sure all of the showError, etc. methods are on the AWTEventThread
rather than the calling thread.

*)  all MessagingExceptions should be handled correctly, not ignored.  there
should only be a few of these left.

*) add ability of setting return values by hand (not by UserProfile) on 
	new messages.


*) make an option where message windows size to the viewport of the
desktop pane.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

*)  when you change users for a new message, then, even if the theme 
doesn't change, you still resize the window.

*) add pgp/gpg support.

*) read messages don't get font color set properly.  works in jdk1.4.

*) add support for external editors, such as emacs.

*) address book/ldap support.
	now:
	1)  add ldap support

	later:
	1)  make sure the matches go with the entry--i.e. if you match the
	    actual address, have the actual address appear first.
	2)  make it test for valid email addresses
	3)  make it add an extension to incomplete and unmatched addresses
	    (i.e. change allen to allen@atg.com)


error:  filterfoldercellrenderer has problems with search forms.

*) check:  see how outgoing and incoming mail handle tab characters.
	-- a little bit of a bug, but not too much.  should probably
	check the actual message source to see how tabs are sent.

*)  make the windows detachable. 
	-- done, at least for read messages and new message.
	-- to fix:  
	-- *)  make it not get included for preview pane ui windows.
	-- *)  make it available for folder windows?
	-- *)  the windows are being resized, meaning that if you make the
	       window larger and then detach it, or if you move the split
		pane divider, then it reverts to its original state when you
		detach/attach the window.

*) add a spell checker

*) add threading of messages (?) 

*) set priority (?)

*) expand an unopened store in the folder tree that has folders and
	subfolders.  connect to the store.  the subfolders close back up.

*) loadMessageTracker?  it doesn't seem to show up anymore.

*)  make it so file->exit gives you the option for expunging deleted messages
    from your mailboxes.

*) bug:  if you go into the multi configuration editors and it's empty, you
should more or less be forced to create a new entity.  otherwise you'll start
typing in information and then be surprised when add clears it out.

*) bug:  trying to go to a folder editor when there aren't any folders
or stores configured is a big problem.

*) some messages aren't parsed properly by the mbox provider.
*) the mbox provider isn't safe for mailboxes that are edited by
	     other processes.

*) fix the jfilechooser so it doesn't disconnect all of our folders when you
use it--or at least so it doesn't matter if it does.  -- only on unix.  
	doesn't happen on linux with latest glibc?

*) a nested message which is of type text/html doesn't get shown on the
	display.

*) enable voice control

*) make a way to edit the mailcap bindings other than just the 'make default'
option.

*) multi-deleted throw a NPE

*) currently, we only really support a signature file, though the ability
is there to do all kinds of signature generators.  implement support for
alternate signature methods.

*)  implement a way to make a custom FolderCellRenderer for a property.

*)  implement (likely similar) way to put constraints/checks on the values
entered through a propertyEditor.

*) make the scrolling work properly for all border cases, such as a single new
window at -5, -5.

*) make printing nicer--it's pretty basic now.

*) add interfaces for all the rest of the features.  :)

*) add ldap support

*) add 'edit message as new' for normal messages.

*) add ability to edit received messages, so you can do things like remove
attachments that you don't want to keep (?)

*) name all of your threads.

*) customize settings on folder window--headers, window size.

*) make required fields for the gui properties.

*) check it to see if we can still get the same kind of 
	folders-always-available performance while not keeping a separate
	imapd connection open for each folder.

make an update Thread -- sort of done.  need to institute update time.
