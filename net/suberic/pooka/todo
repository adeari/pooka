beta 1
---------------

immediate todo: 

	fix the load message tracker

	add the delete ui and make it actually controllable by a checkbox.

	add a way to move directly to a message.

	fix the window sizing.

ui engine
---------
*)  make the windows detachable.

*) add an optional preview pane.

*) bug:  i seem to have broken some of the sizing code.

*) fix all of the thread issues that i've introduced.  :)

general ui
----------
*) revamp the UserProfile, Store, and Folder editing process.  make a full
screen for each with all the possible information (update time, colors,
connection information, trash/sent folders, etc.) available, and make it
so you can edit them by right-clicking on the folder.  in other words, do
a big ui overhaul.

*) takes too long to open a window where there are a lot of new messages.
	note:  this is much better now.

*) add the ability to save messages to files.

*) add ability to reply/forward with attachments, or as inline, and so forth

*) add copying messages.

*) add delete/expunge support, or at least enable it.  

*) add undo/redo support

*) make it so you can skip directly to any message in the folder.

protocol support
----------------
*) add pop3/local mail spool support.

*) add disconnected imap support.  thoughts:  1)  cache headers so that we
can make an InternetHeaders object.  2)  cache full messages so we can get
all the information we need off the Message.  3)  effectively have a 'real'
message which is what you make changes on.  4)  searches won't work in 
disconnected mode.

*) fix the jfilechooser so it doesn't disconnect all of our folders when you
use it--or at least so it doesn't matter if it does.

*) support for ssl?

searching
---------
*) add a search and replace for the message editors.

*) add something to search through all messages in the folder.

*) add support for mail filters.
	to be supported:
	match:  header, subject, date, flags
	match type:  (not) contains, is, begins with, ends with, is before,
	 	     is after
	actions:  move to folder, change priority, delete, mark read
other
-----
*)  fix the out of memory problems--only load a certain amount of large
messages.  for that matter, maybe also do an optimizeit audit.

*) add address book and alias support

*) fix bug with showing a new message--right now, if your imap connection is
hanging and you try to show a new message, the entire app will hang.

*) same bug can happen when getting the attachment count from the Attachment
Panel.  we need to cache that.

*) bug:  there's a problem either with line wrapping or with the size of the
ReadMessageWindow.  They should be the same size, such that if you read a
message that you wrote, the lines will wrap at the correct place.

*) bug:  send mail seems to be on the awt event thread.

*) bug:  handle attachments of type X-UNKNOWN

*) bug:  the MenuBar.Mail.Move resource isn't loaded on first startup.

after beta 1
----------------

*) enable voice control

*) make a way to edit the mailcap bindings other than just the 'make default'
option.

*) currently, we only really support a signature file, though the ability
is there to do all kinds of signature generators.  implement support for
alternate signature methods.

*)  implement a way to make a custom FolderCellRenderer for a property.

*)  implement (likely similar) way to put constraints/checks on the values
entered through a propertyEditor.

*)  check on file->exit to make sure that there are no unsent messages,
and give an option on what you want to do with each one if there are any.

*)  check all of my actions and make sure that they are threading 
properly--both that the email work is being done on the proper thread,
and that all the gui updates are happening on the EventDispatcher thread.

*)  all MessagingExceptions should be handled correctly, not ignored.

*) delete for multiple messages takes way too long.

*) make the scrolling work properly for all border cases, such as a single new
window at -5, -5.

*) fix the display of the messages in the FolderWindow--right now, you get
too much date info, not enough Subject.

*) make printing nicer--it's pretty basic now.

*) select all/all messages

*) add interfaces for all the rest of the features.  :)

*) add more font support

*) add 'edit message as new'

*) add ldap support

*) add pgp/gpg support.

*) add ability to edit received messages, so you can do things like remove
attachments that you don't want to keep (?)

*) fix sorting of the from field--make it case-insensitive.
