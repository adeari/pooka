beta 1
---------------

*) check:  see how outgoing and incoming mail handle tab characters.

--

*) add address book and alias support

*)  fix the out of memory problems--only load a certain amount of large
messages.  for that matter, maybe also do an optimizeit audit.

*) bug:  messages that are new for the session (i.e. showed up between the
last time you ran the client and this time) aren't marked as recent--only
ones that come in while you're already connected are labelled like that.

*) bug:  make the FolderSelectorPanel work for all stores/folders instead of
just for the current store/folder.

--

*) add copying messages.

*) add ability to reply/forward with attachments, or as inline, and so forth

*) bug:  new message notification doesn't work for folders with both messages
and subfolders.

ui engine
---------
*)  make the windows detachable. 
	-- done, at least for read messages and new message.
	-- to fix:  1)  location isn't quite right for top-level frame to
	   intenral frame change.
	-- 2)  make it not get included for preview pane ui windows.
	-- 3)  make it available for folder windows?
	-- 4)  the windows are being resized, meaning that if you make the
	       window larger and then detach it, or if you move the split
		pane divider, then it reverts to its original state when you
		detach/attach the window.

*) fix all of the thread issues that i've introduced.  :)

general ui
----------
*) revamp the UserProfile, Store, and Folder editing process.  make a full
screen for each with all the possible information (update time, colors,
connection information, trash/sent folders, etc.) available, and make it
so you can edit them by right-clicking on the folder.  in other words, do
a big ui overhaul.

*) add the ability to save messages to files.

*) add undo/redo support

protocol support
----------------
*) add disconnected imap support.  thoughts:  1)  cache headers so that we
can make an InternetHeaders object.  2)  cache full messages so we can get
all the information we need off the Message.  3)  effectively have a 'real'
message which is what you make changes on.  4)  searches won't work in 
disconnected mode.

*) fix the jfilechooser so it doesn't disconnect all of our folders when you
use it--or at least so it doesn't matter if it does.

*) add pop3/local mail spool support.

*) support for ssl?

searching
---------
*) add something to search through all messages in the folder.

*) add support for mail filters.
	to be supported:
	match:  header, subject, date, flags
	match type:  (not) contains, is, begins with, ends with, is before,
	 	     is after
	actions:  move to folder, change priority, delete, mark read

*) add a search and replace for the message editors.

other
-----
*) bug:  send mail seems to be on the awt event thread.

*) fix bug with showing a new message--right now, if your imap connection is
hanging and you try to show a new message, the entire app will hang.

*) same bug can happen when getting the attachment count from the Attachment
Panel.  we need to cache that.

*) bug:  the MenuBar.Mail.Move resource isn't loaded on first startup.

*) loadMessageTracker?

after beta 1
----------------

*) enable voice control

*) make a way to edit the mailcap bindings other than just the 'make default'
option.

*) currently, we only really support a signature file, though the ability
is there to do all kinds of signature generators.  implement support for
alternate signature methods.

*)  implement a way to make a custom FolderCellRenderer for a property.

*)  implement (likely similar) way to put constraints/checks on the values
entered through a propertyEditor.

*)  check on file->exit to make sure that there are no unsent messages,
and give an option on what you want to do with each one if there are any.

*)  check all of my actions and make sure that they are threading 
properly--both that the email work is being done on the proper thread,
and that all the gui updates are happening on the EventDispatcher thread.

*)  all MessagingExceptions should be handled correctly, not ignored.

*) delete for multiple messages takes way too long.

*) make the scrolling work properly for all border cases, such as a single new
window at -5, -5.

*) make printing nicer--it's pretty basic now.

*) select all/all messages

*) add interfaces for all the rest of the features.  :)

*) add more font support

*) add 'edit message as new'

*) add ldap support

*) add pgp/gpg support.

*) add ability to edit received messages, so you can do things like remove
attachments that you don't want to keep (?)

*) fix sorting of the from field--make it case-insensitive.
