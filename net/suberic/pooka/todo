-------

open messages from the FolderWindow
	can do.  todo on this:
	customize settings--headers, window size.
	check the window size if there are lots of 'to' or 'cc' entries.

create and send message
	can do.  todo on this:
	fix the signature
	add ability of setting return values by hand (not by UserProfile)
	make a sent folder

user profiles/information
	can do.  todo:
	make sure that the sendMailURL is properly updated as soon as it's
		entered.  i think right now you have to restart, or reopen
		folders, or something like that.

Editing Profiles/Stores
	can do.  todo:
		make required fields.

closing the window doesn't exit program.

make an update Thread -- sort of done.  need to institute update time.

attachments available from message list.

the Spice is life

add Font stuff.

hourglass for blocking actions--fix it. -?? may be a 1.2 bug; things work
fine in 1.3.

implement the signatures properly.  

write profile changes to disk immediately on setting (?)

BUGS
---------
updates of pkamailrc aren't handled correctly--some lines aren't deleted.

actions on FolderPanel are always available in the menu.
