1)  Make MessageProxy a real proxy--make a loaded flag and go ahead and
create the Proxies, then load them lazily/in the background.

2)  Make the FolderTable load last message first, and start out at the
bottom of the table.

3)  Make a proper listener and updater so that you can get new messages and
have deleted messages update properly.

4)  Fix the display of the MultiPropertyEditor.

5)  Add the ability to subscribe to/add new folders.

open messages from the FolderWindow
	can do.  todo on this:
	customize settings--headers, window size.
	the window size just isn't right--if you have too many to's, or
	  if the message is too long, it doesn't fit the window.

create and send message
	can do.  todo on this:
	fix the signature
	add ability of setting return values by hand (not by UserProfile)
	make a sent folder?
	add ability to attach files (should be easy)	

move messages between folders
	can do.  todo on this:
		update tables correctly--currently, table isn't redrawn after
			message is expunged.

indications for unread messages (bold the folders on the right?)

delete message
	can do.  todo on this:
		make it work properly.  i get exceptions all the time.

user profiles/information
	can do.  todo:
	make it actually get the correct default profile.
	make entry lists the right size.
	make entry list defaults not editable.

Editing Profiles/Stores
	can do.  todo:
		make things update dynamically--FolderPane and input
			boxes.	
		make required fields.
		make it so the forms show up correctly the first time--
			specifically the empty field size.

auth fails isn't caught

closing the window doesn't exit program.

make an update Thread -- sort of done.  need to institute update time.

messages should have send buttons on them.

attachments available from message list.

implement Window Menu as Dynamic Menu.

the Spice is life

add Font stuff.

ui:
	new folder

hourglass for blocking actions.

BUGS
---------
tables aren't updated properly when messages are removed or added.  same for
the tree of folders.

Send is enabled for read (non-editable) messages.

actions on messageProxy aren't available for MessageWindow--and ones on 
MessageWindow aren't available for the selected message in the table.

updates of pkamailrc aren't handled correctly--some lines aren't deleted.

downloading a large folder takes a hell of a long time.

actions on FolderPanel are always available in the menu.

none of the window sizings are right.
