alpha release
-------------

*)  make the default profile for each folder work properly.  right now it
just gives you the default profile for the system, rather than making it 
depend on what folder you're currently reading.

*)  fix the MessageWindow sizes--they're way too big now.

*)  make the editor for new messages wrap properly at 75 (or user configurable)
characters.

*)  Fix the display of the MultiPropertyEditor.--especially the 'don't show
the password on the screen' part.

*)  While we're at it, do a simple encryption of the password fields in the
.pookarc file so that you can read .pookarc and not have everyone see your
password.

*)  add context-sensitive menus (right-click menus)

*)  make the GUI Authenticator (which should come up when you don't enter
your password in the Store Configuration) work--right now it doesn't.  note:
it actually works ok (just ok) when you start it up from scratch--but when
you make a new Store without a password, it shows up lots and lots of times
and basically just fails all over the place.

*)  add the ability to forward messages (oops)

*)  enable keybindings so they work properly.

*)  make cut & paste work from the Toolbar.

*)  make the FolderChooser less clunky.  add the ability to create and
remove Folders.

*)  make the subscribe/unsubscribe folder functionality more easilty 
available.

*) add a ValueChangeListener for the UserProfile properties.  right now
the UserProfile only gets updated at startup.

*) make the mailcap mappings for the attachments work properly.

*) make the MessageWindow honor the inline tag for inlined attachments.

*) add Help->About Pooka.  :)

after release
-------------

*)  make the windows detachable.

*)  implement a way to make a custom FolderCellRenderer for a property.

*)  implement (likely similar) way to put constraints/checks on the values
entered through a propertyEditor.

*)  all MessagingExceptions should be handled correctly, not ignored.

*)  the piece of code that keeps the Stores open only starts up if you open
a FolderWindow.  so if you just start up the program and don't open any windows
for a while, your connection to your Store can go down.

*) delete for multiple messages takes way too long.

*) takes too long to open a window where there are a lot of new messages.

*) need to separate requests out into different threads.  right now, it's way
too easy for the entire client to hang if your network connection hangs, be
it checking to see if there are new messages, loading the information on 
current messages, etc.

-------

open messages from the FolderWindow
	can do.  todo on this:
	customize settings--headers, window size.
	check the window size if there are lots of 'to' or 'cc' entries.

create and send message
	can do.  todo on this:
	fix the signature
	add ability of setting return values by hand (not by UserProfile)
	make a sent folder
	make it so that if there are any errors sending the message, that it's
		saved and editable.  not quite sure what to do there with a 
		send thread, but....

user profiles/information
	can do.  todo:
	make it actually get the correct default profile.
	make sure that the sendMailURL is properly updated as soon as it's
		entered.  i think right now you have to restart, or reopen
		folders, or something like that.

Editing Profiles/Stores
	can do.  todo:
		make things update dynamically--FolderPane and input
			boxes.	
		make required fields.

auth fails isn't caught

closing the window doesn't exit program.

make an update Thread -- sort of done.  need to institute update time.

attachments available from message list.

implement Window Menu as Dynamic Menu.

the Spice is life

add Font stuff.

hourglass for blocking actions--fix it.

implement the signatures properly.  

write profile changes to disk immediately on setting (?)

BUGS
---------
updates of pkamailrc aren't handled correctly--some lines aren't deleted.

actions on FolderPanel are always available in the menu.

none of the window sizings are right.

adding a new UserProfile isn't noticed by the new message window--you still get
only the old choices until you restart.
