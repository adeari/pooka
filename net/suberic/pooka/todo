*) icons:  need new message in inbox for atg 

*) fix synch w/subscribed folders and INBOX problem.

*) -- windows --
  *) support windows registry attachment associations.
	-- check icemail
  *) printing in windows can leave control characters at the end of lines
  *) in windows, a file being sent to an application will need to have the
	correct extension.  otherwise, the app (like word) won't recognize
	it as the correct filetype.

*) check for memory leaks
 -- especially w/preview pane mode?

*) make sure that if you close a store, it doesn't reopen it.

*) fix protocol timeout for imap/ssl? -- update this todo with more
	specifics.  -- i think it's that if we lose our connection but 
	don't notice, then we try to restore the connection and wait a 
	long long time. -- test.

*) add documentation and online help.
  -- general info, plus more detailed configuration information.
	topics:
	  running pooka
	  copyright/gpl
	  keybindings
	  configuring stores (imap,pop3,mbox)
	  reading mail
	  new mail
	  user profiles
	  outgoing mail config
	  network connections
	  disconnected operation
	  address book
	  searches
	  subscribing/unsubscribing folders
	  ui types
	  trash folder
	  sent folder
	  outgoing mail folder

*) add help for config stuff.

*) make sure all help gets included in dist-full

*) make there a build option for help only, so i can switch it in 
	WebStart.

*) fix up the error messages, and make sure that they look ok.

-----

*) fix connection failed message for ssl stores -- only fixable by sun?

*) preview pane: 
	--make it so the status bar is at the bottom, underneath
	the readmessagedisplaypanel--or possibly on the status pane.
	-- maybe change the toolbars so there's only 1?
	-- ?? make it so you can compose messages in the main window ??

*) document keybindings
	-- keybindings for address book
	-- keybindings for address entry panel
	-- keybindings for saving attachments.
	-- keybindings for opening folders.
	-- keybindings for detachwindow

*) NPE -- is that from switching from preview to desktop?
	-- check window menu from switching preview to desktop.

*) disconnected from store (like if the server goes down) doesn't result in 
icons changing?  test.

*) status messages:  make them appear and disappear at appropriate times.

*) check disconnection/reconnection on network removal/restoral.

preview:
	check what happens when we switch from desktop to preview and
		autopreview is off

*) disconnected:  
	*)  make an option for caching everything.
	*)  check sent folder with disconnected / especially not using
		the NetworkConnection object. -- note:  ok with the
		NetworkConnection.
	      -- making that work better.  now we add the message, but
	         it shows up as not cached.  also, change the algorithm
	         for numbering.
	*)  disconnected:  think that you're still connected.  lose connection.
	    get new messages.  doesn't work properly.
	*)  reading a message in disconnected mode doesn't actually mark
	     it read. -- ?? test.  seems to work.
	*)  add:  autocache up to a certain size.

*) make a way to reopen folders that have been disconnected other than
	closing and reopening the store. -- get testcase?
	-- make it so there's a way to close the store that actually resets
	the connection totally, so that if your network is screwed up 
	pooka can recover without restarting.

*) editors:  add listeners:  intFilter, enabledIfOtherFilter.  requiredFilter.

*) splashscreen?

*) umm, implement tile and cascade.  :)

*) make it so you can add to the address book from the selection
		panel.

*) threading of attachment actions.

+++ version 1.1 +++++++++++++++ 

*) add support for jdk1.4
	-- tabbing between the address components for New Messages
	-- the MailFileSystemView doesn't seem to work at all (!)
	-- up and down arrows while composing new messages.
	-- ssl doesn't work.

*) add support for other mail formats, like maildir (and maybe hotmail?).
	shift pop3 backing from mbox to maildir.

*) queuing of outgoing mails
	todo on this:
	*)  add some sort of an administrative api to the NetworkConnection
		so that the application and the admin tools (the bottom right
		config) don't have the same restrictions (or lack thereof).
		 -- somewhat started with the new test address api.
	*) make it so there is some way for the NetworkConnection to detect
		whether or not it's up.
			-- started.  make sure it's enough.

*) forward to all.
 
*) fix the network connection test so that it doesn't hang if the
	network is up, but the test host is unreachable.

*) come up with a wrapper for spawning external editors on windows.

*) make it so folders that can contain folders but have no subfolders have
	the correct icon.

*) get some decent pooka icons.
	
*) search for sent folders ends up doing loading on the display thread.

*) make search window look different than normal window.

*) add support for saved searches.

*) add 'filter by message'

*) add icons for connecting to folder/store

*) attachments available from message list (like actually being able to
	click on and view/save without opening the message).

*) make it so we only get one connection failed message for a store.

*) sent folders, outboxes, etc. should be configured without requiring a
	restart.  also, should be able to change store protcol/connection
	info without restarting.

*) fix:java.lang.NullPointerException
	at net.suberic.pooka.FolderInfo.getTrashFolder(Unknown Source)
	at net.suberic.pooka.MultiMessageInfo.deleteMessage(Unknown Source)
	(from search folder)

*) fix:java.lang.NullPointerException
	at net.suberic.pooka.gui.MessageProxy.refreshMessage(MessageProxy.java:353)
	at net.suberic.pooka.thread.LoadMessageThread.loadWaitingMessages(LoadMessageThread.java:185)
	at net.suberic.pooka.thread.LoadMessageThread.run(LoadMessageThread.java:53)

*) make it so you can stop html displays from showing non-local images.
 	-- support RFC-2557??

*) add support for composing new email messages from an external source,
say, like reacting to a mailto: link.

*) add a search and replace for the message editors.

*) check the open/close/open pattern on disconnected folders.

	-- disconnected imap --

*) check to see what happens when we lose our connection before all of
	the messages are loaded (esp. before the tableinfos are loaded)

*) we're getting a weird flash of 'loading', probably when we're caching
	the message.

*) each loading of the FolderTableInfo rechecks the unread message
	count, which sucks for performance.  improvements with new
	caching system???

*) each loading we also recache the flags no matter what.  this is probably
not very efficient.

*) reply to an email from you should go to the recipient.

---

*)  check all of my actions and make sure that they are threading 
properly--both that the email work is being done on the proper thread,
and that all the gui updates are happening on the EventDispatcher thread.

*) bug:  make sure all of the showError, etc. methods are on the AWTEventThread
rather than the calling thread.

*)  all MessagingExceptions should be handled correctly, not ignored.  there
should only be a few of these left.

*) add ability of setting return values by hand (not by UserProfile) on 
	new messages.


*) make an option where message windows size to the viewport of the
desktop pane.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

*)  when you change users for a new message, then, even if the theme 
doesn't change, you still resize the window.

*) add pgp/gpg support.

*) read messages don't get font color set properly.  works in jdk1.4.

*) add support for external editors, such as emacs.

*) address book/ldap support.
	now:
	1)  add ldap support

	later:
	1)  make sure the matches go with the entry--i.e. if you match the
	    actual address, have the actual address appear first.
	2)  make it test for valid email addresses
	3)  make it add an extension to incomplete and unmatched addresses
	    (i.e. change 'allen' to 'allen@somehostname.org')


*) fix the launcher (specifically the html launcher, but maybe all of them)
to use "'s correctly.  works for now with opera, which should be good 
enough...

error:  filterfoldercellrenderer has problems with search forms.

*) check:  see how outgoing and incoming mail handle tab characters.
	-- a little bit of a bug, but not too much.  should probably
	check the actual message source to see how tabs are sent.

*)  make the windows detachable. 
	-- done, at least for read messages and new message.
	-- to fix:  
	-- *)  make it not get included for preview pane ui windows.
	-- *)  make it available for folder windows?
	-- *)  the windows are being resized, meaning that if you make the
	       window larger and then detach it, or if you move the split
		pane divider, then it reverts to its original state when you
		detach/attach the window.

*) add a spell checker

*) add threading of messages (?) 

*) set priority (?)

*) expand an unopened store in the folder tree that has folders and
	subfolders.  connect to the store.  the subfolders close back up.
	-- i think that happens when you have 'sync with subscribed folders'		  set.

*) loadMessageTracker?  it doesn't seem to show up anymore.

*)  make it so file->exit gives you the option for expunging deleted messages
    from your mailboxes.

*) bug:  if you go into the multi configuration editors and it's empty, you
should more or less be forced to create a new entity.  otherwise you'll start
typing in information and then be surprised when add clears it out.

*) bug:  trying to go to a folder editor when there aren't any folders
or stores configured is a big problem.

*) some messages aren't parsed properly by the mbox provider.
*) the mbox provider isn't safe for mailboxes that are edited by
	     other processes.

*) fix the jfilechooser so it doesn't disconnect all of our folders when you
use it--or at least so it doesn't matter if it does.  -- only on unix.  
	doesn't happen on linux with latest glibc?

*) a nested message which is of type text/html doesn't get shown on the
	display.

*) enable voice control

*) make a way to edit the mailcap bindings other than just the 'make default'
option.

*) multi-deleted throw a NPE

*) currently, we only really support a signature file, though the ability
is there to do all kinds of signature generators.  implement support for
alternate signature methods.

*)  implement a way to make a custom FolderCellRenderer for a property.

*)  implement (likely similar) way to put constraints/checks on the values
entered through a propertyEditor.

*) make the scrolling work properly for all border cases, such as a single new
window at -5, -5.

*) make printing nicer--it's pretty basic now.

*) add interfaces for all the rest of the features.  :)

*) add ldap support

*) add 'edit message as new' for normal messages.

*) add support for flowed text

*) add color support for replies (i.e. > in one color, >> in another, etc.)

*) add ability to edit received messages, so you can do things like remove
attachments that you don't want to keep (?) -- and change the subject.

*) name all of your threads.

*) customize settings on folder window--headers, window size.

*) add customization editor for toolbars and menus. 

*) make required fields for the gui properties.

*) check it to see if we can still get the same kind of 
	folders-always-available performance while not keeping a separate
	imapd connection open for each folder.

make an update Thread -- sort of done.  need to institute update time.
