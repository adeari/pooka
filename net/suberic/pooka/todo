alpha release
-------------

*) add Help->About Pooka.  :)


after release
-------------

*) make MailUtilities handle nested attachments properly.  also honour
multipart/alternative content.

*)  Do a simple encryption of the password fields in the
.pookarc file so that you can read .pookarc and not have everyone see your
password.

*)  add context-sensitive menus (right-click menus)

*)  fix what happens if you select an unreachable/incorrectly written
mailbox--right now it hangs.

*)  associated with above, multithread properly--too many actions happen
on the main i/o thread.

*)  fix the occasional NullPointerException in the FolderInfo (?)

*)  fix the response window size when there are lots of people in the 
address fields--right now it makes the entire window huge.

*)  add 1.3 compatibility.

*)  fix the actions update when a message is unselected/deleted.

*)  make the FolderChooser less clunky.  add the ability to create and
remove Folders.

*)  make the subscribe/unsubscribe folder functionality more easilty
available.

*)  make the windows detachable.

*)  add a way to edit the mailcap file.

*)  implement a way to make a custom FolderCellRenderer for a property.

*)  implement (likely similar) way to put constraints/checks on the values
entered through a propertyEditor.

*)  all MessagingExceptions should be handled correctly, not ignored.

*)  the piece of code that keeps the Stores open only starts up if you open
a FolderWindow.  so if you just start up the program and don't open any windows
for a while, your connection to your Store can go down.

*) delete for multiple messages takes way too long.

*) takes too long to open a window where there are a lot of new messages.

*) need to separate requests out into different threads.  right now, it's way
too easy for the entire client to hang if your network connection hangs, be
it checking to see if there are new messages, loading the information on 
current messages, etc.

*) fix the display of the messages in the FolderWindow--right now, you get
too much date info, not enough Subject.

*) add an optional preview pane.

*) add a search and replace for the message editors.

*) add something to search through all messages in the folder.

*) restore the Window Menu.

*) restore the move messages between folders functionality.

*) create a Trash folder.

*) add the ability to print

*) add the ability to save messages to files.

*) make the folderWindow sortable

*) add ability to reply/forward with attachments, or as inline, and so forth

*) enable voice control

-------

open messages from the FolderWindow
	can do.  todo on this:
	customize settings--headers, window size.
	check the window size if there are lots of 'to' or 'cc' entries.

create and send message
	can do.  todo on this:
	fix the signature
	add ability of setting return values by hand (not by UserProfile)
	make a sent folder

user profiles/information
	can do.  todo:
	make sure that the sendMailURL is properly updated as soon as it's
		entered.  i think right now you have to restart, or reopen
		folders, or something like that.

Editing Profiles/Stores
	can do.  todo:
		make required fields.

closing the window doesn't exit program.

make an update Thread -- sort of done.  need to institute update time.

attachments available from message list.

implement Window Menu as Dynamic Menu.

the Spice is life

add Font stuff.

hourglass for blocking actions--fix it. -?? may be a 1.2 bug; things work
fine in 1.3.

implement the signatures properly.  

write profile changes to disk immediately on setting (?)

BUGS
---------
updates of pkamailrc aren't handled correctly--some lines aren't deleted.

actions on FolderPanel are always available in the menu.
