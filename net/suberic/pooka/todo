alpha 2
----------

*) enable voice control

*) fix the attachment pop up on windows.

*)  fix the occasional NullPointerException in the FolderInfo (?) -- might
    be done already. -- note:  this is probably happening because of the
    fact that swing components aren't thread safe (!).  i should make
    the other threads, especially things that happen from the mail event
    update thread, use SwingUtilities.invokeLater().

*) finish fixing the threading problems--specifically, see if we can get
the FolderWindow to refresh properly, the ReadMessageWindow to come up with
an AttachmentPane, and the new message windows to look a bit better when
they appear (i.e. actually appear in front).
	*) note: folderWindow would do deletes better if we batched them
	   up; SwingUtilities.invokeLater() will probably help, too.
	*) new windows will appear at front and selected if we set the
	   layer properly when we create the windows.

*)  fix the response window size when there are lots of people in the 
address fields--right now it makes the entire window huge.

*)  add 1.3 compatibility.  current issues:
	*)  FolderWindow comes up showing first message rather than last
	*)  NewMessageWindow splitPane not in the right location.
	*)  (sort of) folderPanel isn't being sized properly now.

*)  fix the actions update when a message is unselected/deleted.

*)  add a way to edit the mailcap file.  this should be doable both from
a menu option and from the 'open with' dialog.

*)  make the windows detachable.

*) create a Trash folder.

*) make the DesktopPane scroll/resize properly. -- almost done.

after alpha 2
----------------

*)  make a sent folder.

*)  fix the signature.

*)  make the FolderChooser less clunky.  add the ability to create and
remove Folders.

*)  make the subscribe/unsubscribe folder functionality more easilty
available.

*)  implement a way to make a custom FolderCellRenderer for a property.

*)  implement (likely similar) way to put constraints/checks on the values
entered through a propertyEditor.

*)  all MessagingExceptions should be handled correctly, not ignored.

*) delete for multiple messages takes way too long.

*) takes too long to open a window where there are a lot of new messages.

*) fix the display of the messages in the FolderWindow--right now, you get
too much date info, not enough Subject.

*) add pop3/local mail spool support.

*) add an optional preview pane.

*) add a search and replace for the message editors.

*) add something to search through all messages in the folder.

*) add the ability to print

*) add the ability to save messages to files.

*) make the folderWindow sortable

*) add ability to reply/forward with attachments, or as inline, and so forth

*) add copying messages.

*) add undo/redo support

*) select all/all messages

*) add interfaces for all of the features.  :)

*) add support for mail filters.

*) add more font support

*) add 'edit message as new'

*) add address book and alias support

*) add ldap support

*) add pgp/gpg support.

*) add ability to edit received messages, so you can do things like remove
attachments that you don't want to keep (?)

-------

open messages from the FolderWindow
	can do.  todo on this:
	customize settings--headers, window size.
	check the window size if there are lots of 'to' or 'cc' entries.

create and send message
	can do.  todo on this:
	fix the signature
	add ability of setting return values by hand (not by UserProfile)
	make a sent folder

user profiles/information
	can do.  todo:
	make sure that the sendMailURL is properly updated as soon as it's
		entered.  i think right now you have to restart, or reopen
		folders, or something like that.

Editing Profiles/Stores
	can do.  todo:
		make required fields.

closing the window doesn't exit program.

make an update Thread -- sort of done.  need to institute update time.

attachments available from message list.

the Spice is life

add Font stuff.

hourglass for blocking actions--fix it. -?? may be a 1.2 bug; things work
fine in 1.3.

implement the signatures properly.  

write profile changes to disk immediately on setting (?)

BUGS
---------
updates of pkamailrc aren't handled correctly--some lines aren't deleted.

actions on FolderPanel are always available in the menu.
