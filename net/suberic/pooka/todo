top todo:

(windows)

*) (related to above) check to make sure that files (especially the address
	book file) are created correctly under windows. -- especially check
	handing of '\' in properties.

------------------

*) bug:  the ReadMessageDisplayPanel always uses both EditorPanes.  this is
	probably extremely inefficient.  

*) fix it so no tableInfos are ever loaded on the awt even thread.  this
	means that we'll probably have to either a) load all of the 
	tableInfos before we add the messages to the FolderTable, or b)
	have a way to display unloaded infos, and an event system that will
	update the table when the tableInfo is loaded.

*) fix the window size--it's possible that if you change the foldertable
size and the desktop pane size, but not the main window size, your main
window size will end up changing anyway.

*) add a browser to browse/select all registered (open or not) Folders.  in 
other words, we want everything that appears in the FolderTree, not all 
possible folders, nor just the ones that are open.

*) fix it so the file (and font and so forth?) editor actually includes
	the '...' icon.

*) test the following:  open a folder.  do right click->close folder.
	try reopening the folder and reading from it.

*) add support for jdk1.4
	-- tabbing between the address components for New Messages
	-- the MailFileSystemView doesn't seem to work at all (!)
	-- up and down arrows while composing new messages.

*) support java jnlp (?)

*) a nested message which is of type text/html doesn't get shown on the
	display.

*) need a way for forward/include html-only messages.

*) come up with a wrapper for spawning external editors on windows.

	-- search --

*) make search give a popup window saying it's running, or at least something
	that makes it obvious that _something's_ going on.

*) make search window look different than normal window.

*) search results window shows all (? at least lots) messages as unread.

	-- disconnect imap --

*) disconnected imap is way too slow.  

*) caching messages marks them as read.

*) no way to cache messages as they come in.

*) make disconnected imap use LoadMessageTracker.
	make disconnected imap not show messages that aren't there!

*) in general, make reconnecting/resynching (with disconnected imap or
	with the uid system) use the LoadMessageThread.  also make the
	LoadMessageThread use the main FolderThread synchronization.

*) new message count on disconnected imap folders is a bit strange.  might 
want to get it from the cache instead of the folder itself when we haven't
downloaded the new messages yet.  kind of weird to see '6 new messages' and
have nothing new in your inbox because it hasn't been d/l'ed yet.

*) incorrect number of messages/unread messages when in disconnected mode.

------------

*)  when you change users for a new message, then, even if the theme 
doesn't change, you still resize the window.

*) add pgp/gpg support.

*) read messages don't get font color set properly.  works in jdk1.4.

*) queuing of outgoing mails
	todo on this:
	*)  fix the local mail store so that it doesn't necessarily put
		in an INBOX for everything.  this is so we can set up a
		local mail store for IMAP users without having to fake
		out the INBOX for it.
	*)  add some sort of an administrative api to the NetworkConnection
		so that the application and the admin tools (the bottom right
		config) don't have the same restrictions (or lack thereof).
	*)  change the new user setup so that it configures an outbox
		automatically.

*) get some decent pooka icons.
	
*) add support for external editors, such as emacs.

*) address book/ldap support.
	now:
	1)  add ldap support

	later:
	1)  make sure the matches go with the entry--i.e. if you match the
	    actual address, have the actual address appear first.
	2)  make it test for valid email addresses
	3)  make it add an extension to incomplete and unmatched addresses
	    (i.e. change allen to allen@atg.com)


error:  filterfoldercellrenderer has problems with search forms.

*) check:  see how outgoing and incoming mail handle tab characters.
	-- a little bit of a bug, but not too much.  should probably
	check the actual message source to see how tabs are sent.

*)  make the windows detachable. 
	-- done, at least for read messages and new message.
	-- to fix:  
	-- *)  make it not get included for preview pane ui windows.
	-- *)  make it available for folder windows?
	-- *)  the windows are being resized, meaning that if you make the
	       window larger and then detach it, or if you move the split
		pane divider, then it reverts to its original state when you
		detach/attach the window.

*) add a search and replace for the message editors.

*) expand an unopened store in the folder tree that has folders and
	subfolders.  connect to the store.  the subfolders close back up.

*) loadMessageTracker?  it doesn't seem to show up anymore.

*)  make it so file->exit gives you the option for expunging deleted messages
    from your mailboxes.

*) bug:  if you go into the multi configuration editors and it's empty, you
should more or less be forced to create a new entity.  otherwise you'll start
typing in information and then be surprised when add clears it out.

*) bug:  trying to go to a folder editor when there aren't any folders
or stores configured is a big problem.

*) some messages aren't parsed properly by the mbox provider.
*) the mbox provider isn't safe for mailboxes that are edited by
	     other processes.

*) fix the jfilechooser so it doesn't disconnect all of our folders when you
use it--or at least so it doesn't matter if it does.  -- only on unix.  
	doesn't happen on linux with latest glibc?

*) fix the startup bugs:  
	1)  windows take too long to show up

*) enable voice control

*) make a way to edit the mailcap bindings other than just the 'make default'
option.

*) currently, we only really support a signature file, though the ability
is there to do all kinds of signature generators.  implement support for
alternate signature methods.

*)  implement a way to make a custom FolderCellRenderer for a property.

*)  implement (likely similar) way to put constraints/checks on the values
entered through a propertyEditor.

*)  check all of my actions and make sure that they are threading 
properly--both that the email work is being done on the proper thread,
and that all the gui updates are happening on the EventDispatcher thread.

*) bug:  make sure all of the showError, etc. methods are on the AWTEventThread
rather than the calling thread.

*)  all MessagingExceptions should be handled correctly, not ignored.  there
should only be a few of these left.

*) make the scrolling work properly for all border cases, such as a single new
window at -5, -5.

*) make printing nicer--it's pretty basic now.

*) add interfaces for all the rest of the features.  :)

*) add ldap support

*) add 'edit message as new' for normal messages.

*) add ability to edit received messages, so you can do things like remove
attachments that you don't want to keep (?)

*) name all of your threads.

*) customize settings on folder window--headers, window size.

*) add ability of setting return values by hand (not by UserProfile) on 
	new messages.

*) make required fields for the gui properties.

*) check it to see if we can still get the same kind of 
	folders-always-available performance while not keeping a separate
	imapd connection open for each folder.

make an update Thread -- sort of done.  need to institute update time.

attachments available from message list.
