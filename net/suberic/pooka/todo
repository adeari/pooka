next release:

	been done.

*) make search window look different than normal window.

beta 1
---------------

*) add address book/ldap support.
	now:
	1)  add ldap support
	2)  make it support aliases/lists properly

	later:
	1)  make sure the matches go with the entry--i.e. if you match the
	    actual address, have the actual address appear first.
	2)  make it test for valid email addresses
	3)  make it add an extension to incomplete and unmatched addresses
	    (i.e. change allen to allen@atg.com)


*) add queuing of outgoing emails.

*) make disconnected imap use LoadMessageTracker.
	make disconnected imap not show messages that aren't there!

*) bug:  search window shows new messages as they come in. (done)

*) enh:  make search window look different from normal message window.

error:  filterfoldercellrenderer has problems with search forms.

*) caching messages marks them as read.

*) no way to cache messages as they come in.

*) no way to connect to all of your subscribed folders.

*) searches don't show a busy icon, or give any other notification that
they're running.

*) fix the sorting of the subject (and from) fields.
---------------

old


*) check:  see how outgoing and incoming mail handle tab characters.
	-- a little bit of a bug, but not too much.  should probably
	check the actual message source to see how tabs are sent.

*) bug:  messages that are new for the session (i.e. showed up between the
last time you ran the client and this time) aren't marked as recent--only
ones that come in while you're already connected are labelled like that.

*) incorrect number of messages/unread messages when in disconnected mode.

ui engine
---------
*)  make the windows detachable. 
	-- done, at least for read messages and new message.
	-- to fix:  
	-- *)  make it not get included for preview pane ui windows.
	-- *)  make it available for folder windows?
	-- *)  the windows are being resized, meaning that if you make the
	       window larger and then detach it, or if you move the split
		pane divider, then it reverts to its original state when you
		detach/attach the window.

general ui
----------
*) add undo/redo support

*) add a search and replace for the message editors.

other
-----
*) loadMessageTracker?

*) add a filter ability to look for duplicate email messages.  so if you're 
on multiple email lists, then it will filter out all but the first copy of
the message.

*) have it change its icon if you get new messages, in addition to changing
the title bar.

*) bug:  if you go into the multi configuration editors and it's empty, you
should more or less be forced to create a new entity.  otherwise you'll start
typing in informatio and then be surprised when add clears it out.

*) bug:  trying to go to a folder editor when there aren't any folders
or stores configured is a big problem.

after beta 1
----------------

*) new message count on disconnected imap folders is a bit strange.  might 
want to get it from the cache instead of the folder itself when we haven't
downloaded the new messages yet.  kind of weird to see '6 new messages' and
have nothing new in your inbox because it hasn't been d/l'ed yet.

*) some messages aren't parsed properly by the mbox provider.
*) the mbox provider isn't safe for mailboxes that are edited by
	     other processes.

*) disconnected imap is way too slow.  

*) fix the jfilechooser so it doesn't disconnect all of our folders when you
use it--or at least so it doesn't matter if it does.  -- only on unix.  
	doesn't happen on linux with latest glibc?

*) fix the startup bugs:  
	1)  windows take too long to show up

*) enable voice control

*) make a way to edit the mailcap bindings other than just the 'make default'
option.

*) currently, we only really support a signature file, though the ability
is there to do all kinds of signature generators.  implement support for
alternate signature methods.

*)  implement a way to make a custom FolderCellRenderer for a property.

*)  implement (likely similar) way to put constraints/checks on the values
entered through a propertyEditor.

*)  check on file->exit to make sure that there are no unsent messages,
and give an option on what you want to do with each one if there are any.

*)  make it so file->exit gives you the option for expunging deleted messages
    from your mailboxes.

*)  check all of my actions and make sure that they are threading 
properly--both that the email work is being done on the proper thread,
and that all the gui updates are happening on the EventDispatcher thread.

*) bug:  make sure all of the showError, etc. methods are on the AWTEventThread
rather than the calling thread.

*)  all MessagingExceptions should be handled correctly, not ignored.  there
should only be a few of these left.

*) make the scrolling work properly for all border cases, such as a single new
window at -5, -5.

*) make printing nicer--it's pretty basic now.

*) select all/all messages

*) add interfaces for all the rest of the features.  :)

*) add more font support

*) add 'edit message as new'

*) add ldap support

*) add pgp/gpg support.

*) add ability to edit received messages, so you can do things like remove
attachments that you don't want to keep (?)

*) name all of your threads.

*) add color support

*) customize settings on folder window--headers, window size.

*) add ability of setting return values by hand (not by UserProfile) on 
	new messages.

*) make required fields for the gui properties.

make an update Thread -- sort of done.  need to institute update time.

attachments available from message list.

the Spice is life

write profile changes to disk immediately on setting (?)

add support for using an external editor, like emacs.
