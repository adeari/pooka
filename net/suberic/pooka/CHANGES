--------------

fixed a bug where two copies of a message could get added to the folder
list.

changed the system that synchronized with the IMAP subscribed folders so 
that it always considers INBOX subscribed.

changed the HTML display method so that, if any errors happen, it shows
the html as text, instead.

OutgoingMailServer system.

weren't being synchronized properly.
