Added a way to delete a folder.

Pooka now remembers its location on screen when restarting.

fixed a problem in Preview mode in which the folder toolbar wouldn't get
activated on startup.

optimized the caching system somewhat so that we're not writing files over
and over agian to the filesystem.  this may also fix a problem where a
message could be cached as blank if the connection to the store broke at
just the right time.

attachment file choosers now remember your last directory, instead of always
starting in your home directory.

messages in Sent folders are no longer shown as new.

fixed theme support in preview pane mode.

changed the way we load the sun ssl class so that pooka will work on 
ibm's jdk 1.4.

made it so you get a warning message if you try to start with an unsupported
JDK.

add a find in page feature for Read Messages.

fixed a problem with the focus not always returning to the correct component.

030115 release
--------------

fixed lots of other problems in jdk 1.4, including incorrect sizing of some
of the configuration dialogs, some times when focus wouldn't follow back from
a deleted message, and....  some other stuff.  don't remember it all.

fixed SSL on jdk 1.4

----- branched for 1.1/2.0 release. -----

fixed a bug where part of the error message was getting shown twice.

made it so the INBOX is required for imap servers.  with luck this will work
around a problem in which the inbox sometimes doesn't show up for imap 
stores.

temporary files for attachments now have the attachment's extension.  

fixed a bug where the copy button on messages wasn't getting enabled.

made it so imap connections time out more quickly.

fixed the build information so that we now include the kunststoff files.

modified the toolbars and the images some.

added an easier interface for adding new folders.

fixed a bug where multipart/alternative messages with additional attachments
weren't getting parsed properly.

added a way to view emails either with full headers or as raw rfc822
streams.

added (limited) online help.

fixed a NPE that could happen if you tried to delete a message that was in
the process of getting deleted.

020918 release
--------------

removed a lot of unused image files.  this should make the download at least
a bit smaller.

fixed the AddressBookEditor so that newly created AddressBooks are 
editable.  you still have to hit 'apply' first to create the address book,
though.

made it so the outbox and sent folder are both properly configured when
you start up the first time.  otherwise, though, they still require a 
restart for changes to be made.  this fix only applies to the first time
you start.

added a default domain setting, so that if you enter in an email address 
without a domain, then the default domain is appended.  if no default domain
is set, then the domain of the user is appended.

fixed an error where incomplete matches to address book entries would return
as if they were complete matches.

fixed an error with subscribing to deeply nested subfolders.

made it so the address entry windows actually show up in desktop mode.

bringing up folders in disconnected mode shows the correct number of
read and unread messages again.

fixed the display of the folders in the folder tree.

made it so new external frames don't end up all going at 0,0.

fixed a possible NPE in the MessageProxy if a message has an incorrectly
formatted header.

fixed a bug where an address without a personal name couldn't be added to
the address book.

added a button for actually using the address list to pull in addresses
to the to:, cc:, and bcc: fields.

changed the message display code so that searches work a bit better with
items in a sent folder.

fixed a possible deadlock in manipulating messages that are the results
of a search.

added a search in progress dialog so that you can see that something's
happening while waiting for search results.

added an attachment icon to the main folder/message table.

020810 release
--------------

NOTE:  i modified the local mail store (mbox) configuration a bit.  if you're
using any local mail folders, you may need to change the Mail Directory and
Inbox File settings.  your inbox is specified by Inbox File; subfolders are
stored in Mail Directory/folders.

pooka can now exit even if all the open stores aren't available.

made it so we don't do unnecessary redraws on the folder panel every time
a message changes or is loaded.

removed several excess communications with the mail store.

added a disconnected icon so that it looks different if you're browsing
messages in connected vs. disconnected imap.

added an icon for the root node in the folder tree.

updated the NewAccountPooka so that you can set a better variety of choices
during setup.

added ssl support for pop3 folders.

added Add buttons to many of the list choices in the configuration editors.
makes it a lot easier to add all of the items that you want in the correct
order.

made the VariableEditorPane change within the editor instead of 
popping up a new window.

made it so by default the ssl seeding is done with /dev/urandom instead of
using the very very slow seeding that SecureRandom uses.  this speeds
up initial ssl connections by a huge factor.

020703 release
--------------

fixed a bug which prevented you from deleting a message from a 
disconnected folder.

in preview pane mode, when you open up a folder, the keyboard focus now
shifts to the message table.

added a progress dialog to caching multiple messages during disconnected
operation.  

changed the sorting method on the message tables.  now clicking a column
a second time will reverse the sort on that column.  doing a shift+click
will still explicitly do a reverse sort.

added an option to preview pane mode in which we don't auto-preview
the selected message.  hitting space or enter now previews the messages.
also added an option not to automatically select the first unread message.
these options are useful for situations in which a person doesn't want a
new message read automatically on folder load.

added keybindings for lots of stuff, including searches, printing, selecting
the next unread message, etc.  added a page showing the keybindings, 
available through the help menu or by pressing Alt-K.

fixed the keybindings on top-level message frames.  those should work now.

selecting a NewMessageWindow now selects either the to: field, the subject:
field, or the text body, depending on which ones are filled out.

changed the display algorithm so that several messages are loaded
before the folder window itself is shown.

made it so exiting pooka before all the messages are loaded doesn't result
in a bunch of exceptions.

improved the startup time, so that open folders show up more quickly.

fixed the popup menu on the attachment pane so that it shows up in the
right place (and isn't selected by default when you right click and 
release).  fixed a similar problem with the nodes in the Folder Tree.

fixed the keybindings in preview pane mode.

020429 release
--------------

fixed a NPE that could happen when switching from preview pane mode to
desktop pane mode.

fixed some minor bugs involving detaching windows.

fixed the theme support so that the default theme is actually used for
just about everything.

fixed a bug where finding the first unread message was done on the 
awt event thread instead of the FolderThread.

fixed pooka so that the default image and text viewers that come with
javamail will actually work when you double click on an attachment.

preview pane mode now gives a resonable size for the message table.

nested subfolders were not being cached when in disconnected imap mode.

fixed a bug where responding or forwarding a message with a null subject
would result in a NullPointerException

fixed a bug where multiple messages could not be copied between folders

changed the load message tracker to synchronize on the folder thread.

fixed a problem where a second request for an invalid message would
result in an empty window.

fixed the status messages so that they should be cleared properly.

fixed disconnected imap autocaching. 

caching messages when using disconnected imap no longer marks the messages
as read.

made some implementation changes to the way that disconnected imap folders
are loaded.  this should result in a fairly substantial performace increase
for large folders.

moved saving emails to a sent folder from the AWTEvent thread to the 
appropriate FolderThread.

fixed the CachingFolderInfo to work with the new display system.

020322 release
--------------

made it so replying to or forwarding messages with only html content results
in the inclusion of the html code.  best i can do for now.

fixed a bug in the search window display in which read messages were included
in the unread message count.

switched the popup menus from checking to see if the event is a right
click to actually checking the isPopupTrigger() method.

changed the new message icon, the folder->Update title to folder->Get
New Messages, and put a new Get New Messages icon on the FolderDisplay.

some properties of the UserProfile, such as the selected sent folder and
the selected mail server, used to require a restart to change them.  they
now change without a restart.

changed the selection of things like the sent folder, trash folder, etc.,
to use only already subscribed folders.

made it so doing an open action on the folder node actually makes sure
that the Folder is in an OPEN state.

changed the display of newly received messages.  now if you try to display
messages before they're loaded, instead of loading the messages on the
AWT thread, you just show 'loading' for each frame.  when the table info
is loaded, the FolderDisplay gets updated with the new values.

made it so that the ReadMessageDisplay only populates one JEditorPane,
instead of 2 like it used to.

made it so that the main Pooka window shouldn't change size between 
starts as often.

changed the window place while in desktop pane mode.  new windows are now
not always places in the top left corner of the desktop.

020304 release
--------------

fixed a bug in the VariableBundle which made it so backslashes weren't
handled properly.  this caused file selection under windows to fail 
horribly.

added support for dynamically switching between LookAndFeels.

clicking Ok on a property editor now saves the current properties to disk.
this means that you no longer have to exit out of pooka cleanly in order to
have your changes save.

fixed an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException if you right-clicked on an entry
in the AttachmentPane that wasn't selected.

fixed a bug where the ExternalLauncher wasn't executing correctly if there
was no wrapper specified.  this resulted in the inability to open attachments
on windows.

fixed a bug where the StoreNode and FolderNode were each updating their
gui components on the mail thread, rather than on the swint eventdispatcher
thread.

added a new default mailcap file, either '.pooka_mailcap' or 
'pooka_mailcap.txt'.  set it up so this file is the one written to by
default.  also reset the 'make command default' so that it actually works
properly.

added more spacing between the headers and the message on html messages.

added an icon for Pooka, and made it change icons when new messages come in.
	BUG:    the Pooka icon doesn't look great when it's made very small,
		and the new message icon is just perfunctory.  should get
		new ones.

improved the startup time for Multi Editor panes.

added support for custom colors and components for most (if not all) 
components.

added a Color selector and a Font selector.

made file->exit check for unsent messages and offer you a chance to send
them.  (BUG:  doesn't work properly under jdk1.2)

added saving messages as drafts (BUG:  doesn't work properly under jdk1.2)

Outbox no longer throws a NPE if the Outbox is not yet open.

added support for specifying SMTP port number (dan)

folder menu now uses submenus to display folders instead of one huge menu (dan)

added selectAll support for read messages, new messages, and the FolderTable.

added undo/redo support for the new message editor

added a File Selector for Configuration properties that take files.


011226 release
--------------

fixed a bug where two copies of a message could get added to the folder
list.

changed the system that synchronized with the IMAP subscribed folders so 
that it always considers INBOX subscribed.

changed the HTML display method so that, if any errors happen, it shows
the html as text, instead.

modified the New Account creation on startup to use the new Connection /
OutgoingMailServer system.

fixed the Search date formater to be MM/dd/yyyy instead of MM/hh/yyyy.

fixed a problem with synchronizing with subscribed IMAP folders--subfolders
weren't being synchronized properly.

made the property editor windows resizable under the desktoppropertyeditor.

changed the SSL server support so that we now can connect using a self-signed
certificate chain.

fixed a bug in UIDFolderInfo which made it so you couldn't append 
non-UIDMimeMessages.

modified the fetch() functionality of the FolderInfos so that we only 
fetch Pooka.fetchBatchSize messages at a time.  this should reduce the amout
of time it takes to display large folders at startup.

changed the SMTP server support so that we now have a separate SMTP server
object, instead of having the servers configured in the UserProfile.

2001 november 05 release
------------------------

fixed new message check algorithm for pop3 folders where old messages are
left on the server.

support added for pre and post connection commands for mailboxes (pilone)

added the ability to synchronize with the IMAP subscribed folders list.

added limited address book support using Vcards.

added support for reading RFC 2047 encoded headers

fixed bug where an outgoing message window could be closed even if the
send failed.

fixed sorting of subject lines and from addresses
