<h1>Encrypting Emails in Pooka</h1>
<p>Pooka supports both S/MIME and OpenPGP, the two most common protocols
for email encryption.  Both are supported using the JavaMail-Crypto library
from SourceForge.  The BouncyCastle encryption library is used as a backend
for S/MIME encryption, while the Cryptix library is used for OpenPGP.</p>
<p>Using each of these protocols, users can sign outgoing emails and read
encrypted emails using their private keys, and encrypt messages and verify
signed messages using other people's public keys.</p>

<h1>Setting up encryption</h1>
<p>Pooka does not yet have the ability to generate new public/private keys
for S/MIME or OpenPGP, so it is necessary to generate these keys in a 
third-party application.  Once you have set these up, you can go into
the Configuration->Encryption Configuration menu.  There you can configure
the location of the keystore files you have created which contain your
public and private keys.</p>
