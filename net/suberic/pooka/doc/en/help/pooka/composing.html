<body>
<p>The help system in Pooka has been added recently, and the actual help
documents have not yet fully been written.  So while some pages are available,
this one isn't.  If you'd like to contribute to
the Pooka documentation, please contact akp@sourceforge.net.</p>

<h1>Composing email in Pooka</h1>

<p>The next thing that you will want to do with Pooka is to send an email.  
This is because, if you have a new email account, you might not actually
have any mail available to you yet.  If you would like to skip ahead to 
reading your mail, go to <a href = "./reading.html">Reading email in Pooka</a>.
</p>

<p>To send an email, first you click on the Create a New Message button in
your toolbar.  (You can also create a new message by going to the 
Mail menu and choosing New Message, or by pressing Control-S.)  A window will
appear.  This is the new message composition window.  It has two areas of
interest:  a set of fields which are used to fill out the envelope information
for the message, and a large text field which is used for the content of the
message.</p>

<p>The evelope information panels consists of the following fields:</p>

<dl>
<dt>User</dt>
<dd></dd>
<dt>To</dt>
<dd></dd>
<dt>CC</dt>
<dd></dd>
<dt>BCC</dt>
<dd></dd>
<dt>Subject</dt>
<dd></dd>
